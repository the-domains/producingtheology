_"Subdue the vocal effects and pull the band back at the top so the singer can say something profound. Get the band back up and push the lick in the intro. Pull guitars back a bit in the first verse. Make sure the vocal effects are back in. Always ride the vocal. Push the pad and add a little delay to the vocal for the ethereal first chorus. Guitars go back up and push the lick in the next break. Take the vocal delay out. Pull the lead guitar back in the 2nd verse. Nudge the eighth note palm-muted guitar up a bit and let the kick, snare, and hat drive. Big epic pad needs to come up in the pre-chorus. Ride the drums up with the build. Drums, guitars, and keys VCA's go to unity for the big second chorus. Put the split harmonizer in. Don't miss the harmonies. Hit the sub-harmonic generator in the bridge. Kill the split harmonizer. Drums and vocals in the first pass of the last chorus. Long and epic verb on the snare. Everything in for the last chorus. Drive the guitars and the strings. Push the lick in the outro. Add the vocal delay to the improv stuff and push it for the trash-can ending. Now press Next.---- What? You just stand there?"\[1\]     - David Stagl_

In the blog post above, David Stagl, the Audio Director at North Point Community Church, in Atlanta, GA, expresses well that in executing their craft, technical artists build upon a contemporary liturgical method, a method of "how-to" actions that parallel instructions found in biblical poetry, most notably in the Book of Psalms. Stagl demonstrates the way he controls exactly how the congregation will receive the worship. Adding and subtracting each instrument to/from the overall mix, the worship piece forms a representation of the way in which the congregation will worship God. The various notes live in harmony with one another, distinguishable both individually and as a whole. The technology itself serves a purpose, but so does the skilled artistry of the tech operating the equipment. The skilled use of the technology creates what Jeremy Begbie calls "a language of the emotions,"\[2\] the attraction that draws listeners to music in the first place. In the case of church music, the emotion is experiential:  more of God, less of us.\[3\] By creating mood, music becomes involved in all aspects of spiritual life and sanctification of the believer. It creates physiological activation, expressive bodily behavior, and a conscious experience, that connects to our innermost state of being⁠.\[4\] Therefore, for church technical artists, presenting the message to the congregation means knowing not just what is being done or what the message is, but how it should be experienced.

The Book of Psalms provides a template for appreciating the importance of liturgical direction in artistic craftsmanship. Thirty-six different musical notations are listed throughout the psalms:\[5\] like "selah" which is found seventy-one times in thirty-nine separate psalms; "to the choirmaster" is directed fifty-five times, and to play with "stringed instruments" is instructed thirteen times. The notations tell the worship leader how to present the psalm (i.e. with strings, flute, or singing), the psalm's author (like David or the sons of Korah), and the mode by which it should be played (e.g. for instruction, with discernment, or in praise). Holly Hearon identifies ironically, "the very thing that makes music so important \[the notational details\] also presents an obvious challenge for researchers today since we have almost no direct access to the music itself and this mostly in the form of fragments."\[6\] Even though exactly what many of these notations meant to the original audience or what the psalms would have sounded like has not been preserved, we can safely conclude the notations did add to the presentation of the storyline, allowing the audience to connect to the song on a more emotional, meaningful, and liturgical level, in the same way Stagl's sound mix does for his congregation.

I do not believe knowing the exact function of each of the musical notations in the Psalms is important for application to contemporary context, however a brief examination can offer a template for understanding the mindset the technical artist should possess in performing his or her craft. First, 'selah,' found in thirty-nine psalms, as well as three times in Habakkuk (3:3, 9, 13), is the only notation---other than 'higgaion' (listed only once directly preceding 'selah' in Psalm 9:16, and translated elsewhere as "whisper/mediation"\[7\])---that is located within the psalm text itself, not as a superscript within the title. A number of speculations regarding the meaning of selah are assumed: pause the performance,\[8\] add narration or particular singing style,\[9\] division or interlude (as rendered by the LXX),\[10\] raise pitch, sustain, lift up, repeat, or swell.\[11\] These various differences only confirm that there is no consensus as to the full meaning of the term, yet its location as sentence suffixes, and four times at the end of a psalm, lead me to believe---assuming universality in musical transference from previous western cultures to today as noted by Hearon\[12\]---that a sustaining note, leading to a pause, creating a tension and resolution fits all uses, both musically and contextually. I concede this is educated speculation on my part, however, from a worship leader and technical artist point of view, the understanding of the term in this way parallels commonly followed liturgical practices.

Two other notations, 'maskil' and 'shigionoth,' are particularly telling, especially when viewed in light of one another. Maskil and shigionoth, respectively, denote the characteristics of wisdom and folly, possessing either confidence or concern in terms of ways to perform the psalms. Brueggemann explains maskil's treatment:

An efficacious psalm is used...\[as\] wisdom (Pss 45; 89), royal (Pss 32; 78) and especially petition (Pss 42/43; 44; 52--55; 74; 88; 142). The term occurs a few other places, generally associated with wisdom and its attendant success (Ps 14:2; 47:7; 1 Sam 18:14--15; Job 22:2; Prov 10:5, 19; 14:35; 16:20; 17:2; 21:12). It derives from śākal, which is most often translated 'succeed, or prosper'; however, it is an intellectual term too, meaning 'comprehend, discern, perceive.'\[13\]

The LXX translation as "ability of comprehension" and "intelligence," as well as the Vulgate denoting it as "understanding" and "intelligence" support this.\[14\] Kyoungwon Choi connects 2 Chronicles 30:22's mention of the "Levites who are skilled (maskilim) in singing and praising God in worship," to which Hans Kosmala adds, "The majority of the passages where śkl forms are used reflect on knowledge of God, and that the term eventually came to refer to 'a person who pleases God.'"\[15\] In contrast, 'shigionoth' represents a term of distress or going astray as seen by Psalm 7's context, David's plea for protection and refuge. Brueggemann notes, "Contemporary treatments...derive it either from the Hebrew šāgâ ('go astray, wander' or 'stagger') or from the Akkadian šigû ('howl, lament, dirge'), ... \[while\] rabbis went for 'impulsive speech,' like David's imprecation against his enemies (citing 1 Samuel 26:10; Psalm 6:10)."\[16\] A parallel use in Habakkuk 3:1---the opening to Habakkuk's prayer pointing to God's faithfulness to deliver his people from the distress and anguish---though with the purpose of extolling God, moves through various emotions of questioning God's sovereignty and plea for righteousness for those lead astray. Interestingly, Habakkuk chooses to sing his prayer, as seen through its incorporation of selah along with concluding instructions to the choirmaster to play with stringed instruments,\[17\] in the same way modern believers sing and perform congregational hymns.

Finally, types of composition are differentiated, suggesting that the way in which each is performed adds to the emotional meaning of the psalm. There are "songs," denoting the explicit command for a vocal performance accompanied by musical "instruments of song."\[18\] There are specific "psalms" which "we might consider...a technical term for temple music."\[19\] As well, miktam, are something "golden" and possibly "precious, or of great worth."\[20\] "Tepilla" are prayers, "which may be 'of David,' 'of Moses,' or 'of someone who is humble, poor, afflicted,' ... \[representing\] petition psalms."\[21\] Last, "tehilla" and "hallelu ya" all signify songs of praise, either generally or directly 'to the Lord.' These various classifications are important for today's technical artists and worship leaders, because they signify an aspect of the psalms that is lost in modern understanding. Standard Bible reading implies the use of poetry through recognition of form, however the original methods of transmission were specific artistically poetic forms. Modern hymnody, however, expresses this same format, bringing back to life the emotional rollercoaster of sorts that was lost in time.

Scriptural meaning may not be lost through a strict reading of the text, but surely the evidence suggests that meaning can be added and/or fortified through performing the psalm using the structured method advised by the psalmist. Enter the role of the modern church technical artist. Supporting this, Steven Guthrie cites fourth century bishop, Athanasius of Alexandria, who "suggests that the Psalms are so spiritually significant precisely because they are not simply read or spoken but sung,"\[22\] and I add performed. Likewise, at a 2012 Leadworship Workshop in Garden Grove, CA, worship leader and popular songwriter, Paul Baloche, taught a songwriting technique of "singing through the psalms."\[23\] Rather than writing a song from scratch, he suggested taking a specific psalmic verse, and playing it musically, allowing the experience to dictate both the musical form and subsequent lyrics. Even though each psalm possesses specific direction as to type, because the millennia removed has lost the original understanding of sound and technique, this method is one that brings promise to regaining the performance value of the psalms. Technical artists, likewise, ought experiment artistically with light and sound, the ways specific scriptural truth can be presented to enforce the textual meaning.

**OT Historical Ritual Becomes NT Practice**

Richard Melick identifies interestingly, "the New Testament says little about musicians assisting in worship, even though they appeared frequently in Israel's worship, as described in the Old Testament."\[24\] However, that does not mean conclusions about NT worship practices cannot be drawn. The Book of Acts shows Paul continuing to observe the traditions of Jewish worship in the temple and synagogue. Paul "purified himself along with them and went into the temple, giving notice when the days of purification would be fulfilled and the offering presented for each one of them (21:26); He "returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple" (22:17), "went up to worship in Jerusalem, and they did not find \[Paul\] disputing ... in the temple, or in the synagogue, or in the city. ... I \[Paul\] confess this to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, I worship" (24:11-13), and Paul was found "purified in the temple" (24:18). In the gospels, Hearon writes, "music...is associated with ritualized acts that symbolically mark or remember a social transition (wedding, death, Passover). Each also references an existing cultural practice."\[25\] Matthew 11:17 and Luke 7:32 show children singing or chanting in the marketplace; Mark 14:26 and Matthew 26:30 refer to Jesus and the apostles singing a hymn as they finish the Passover meal on their way to the Mount of Olives, which most likely were the Hallel Psalms 113-118;\[26\] and Luke 23:27 and John 16:20 "mention the singing of a lament in connection with the death of Jesus."\[27\] As well, certain passages in the New Testament are viewed as being hymns or at least poetic in function, like 'The Magnificat' in Luke 1:46-56\. Last, Paul's parallel passages of Colossians 3:16 and Ephesians 5:19 specifically command the use of 'psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs' for teaching and admonishing the church. Seeing that Jesus and the apostles followed Jewish tradition in worship, even after Christ's resurrection, scripture suggests liturgical and musical traditions were important-to and followed-by the early church, even if not directly stated.

Larry Hurtado finds that "unfortunately for modern historical enquiry, the early Christians did not spend a lot of time analyzing the historical factors that led them to worship Christ, and they have left us no records of discussion about this matter."\[28\] Thus, we must trust the evidence we do have. Martin Stringer is not as optimistic as I am in reaching this conclusion. He comments:

One of the biggest obstacles facing scholars in understanding the nature of Christianity in the first few centuries after the death of Jesus is the temptation to read back presuppositions drawn from the subsequent two thousand years of Christian history. This has been particularly true in the area of worship.\[29\]

He explains one possible reason for this "battleground" has been for Catholics and Protestants to "reinterpret what little evidence there is in a way that supports their own particular understandings."\[30\] Though I concur we cannot conclude a definitive "how-to" from the Bible in regards to worship practices, I believe we can confidently agree that a certain amount of liturgical practice was performed and understood. Because worship ought speak to the beliefs and practices of each existing culture, the exact practices are not important, just as a complete understanding of the musical notations within the psalms does not dismiss the fact they served some important purpose, even if the exact purpose remains unknown.

In conclusion, the scriptural evidence suggests that the early Christians, even after Christ's resurrection and delivery of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, still practiced at least some liturgical traditions found in Jewish worship. James Smith agrees with this conclusion:

To deny the likelihood that first-century Christian and Jewish singing had anything in common would be to fail to appreciate the strength of the circumstantial evidence. Indeed, not only were the earliest Christians Jews, but also some of their signing took place in circumstances that resembled very closely those of private Jewish assemblies where there was religious singing.\[31\]

Likewise, Michael O'Connor asserts, Jesus himself "grew up in a lyrical culture and worshiped in a setting that used musical/lyrical forms regularly and with ease. It would have come naturally to him to sing at prayer; indeed it would have been unnatural not to do so."\[32\] For the early church, the focus of worship shifted from YHWH to Jesus, but the methods seem not to have shifted as radically as the object of worship. For example, Schultze cites, "\[Today,\] a church might replace the greeting 'The Lord be with you' with something as simple as 'good morning,' but the congregation is still participating in liturgy."\[33\] It is a liturgy that is historically grounded, yet contextually changing to fit audience understanding. Important for the technical arts, Joan Huyser-Honig writes, "technology can recreate the past history in a virtual way, making the 'tradition' more real."\[34\] Technologically is the liturgy of the twenty-first century. Though, "worship has to do with a God whom no one has ever seen...worship has to do simultaneously with all the stuff we see. \[Traditionally, it was\] acacia wood, fabrics and skins, tent pegs and altars, tables and flagons."\[35\] Today, technology that follows a skilled liturgical compass is able to create a congregational experience that connects the past with the present, visually, aurally, and even in smell and touch. For example, environmental projection is a new technology in which multiple projectors are synced to create "a visually immersive worship environment that ushers the intimate and powerful role of visuals, art & \[sic\] media back into our modern worship spaces."\[36\] As simple as selecting a presentation slide, a blank-walled church can immerse the congregation in a traditional Roman Catholic cathedral with immaculate stained glass, to the crisp shores of the Sea of Galilee, to the Sistine Chapel, to a futuristic expanse of the New Jerusalem, and to the Garden of Eden.

**The Devil, err The Lord Is in the Details**

The sign of a true artist is that he or she is obsessed with the details that work together to form the final product.\[37\] The old adage states, "The Devil is in the details." Yet, for a church technical artist, it is the Lord who becomes engrained into the foundational fabric. Because of the power that exists for the technical arts to be used for entertainment and glorification of idols rather than God, the technical artist must fully be aware of what is being created. Each piece is built upon another, and therefore being sure that each layer is solidly based in Christ is essential. Even the etymology of the word "technology" from the Greek term "tekhnê" \[τέχνη\] identifies that. Besides having the direct meaning of "art" or "craft,"\[38\] from which we derive "craftsmanship," the Greeks associated tekhnê with the skill of rhetoric, possessing the ability of persuasion.\[39\] "The Greeks recognized that words could influence individuals and society, even shape people's perceptions of reality,"\[40\] Quentin Schultze adds. Therefore, by nature of the craft, technical artists are persuading the reality experienced by the congregation. Thus, how the technical arts are performed is important, down to each individual detail. David Toledo confirms this conclusion: "Private and corporate worship is the experiential application of belief and has tremendous power to shape belief itself."\[41\] Accordingly, technical artists share "great responsibility to structure worship in a way that is theologically sound and in which the content of the liturgy, congregational songs, and worship actions reflect the glory of God in Christ."\[42\] Therefore, the case can be made that each detail that is overlooked for lack of time, resources, or because 'no one will notice anyway,' is indeed persuading the congregation to understand the message in a particular way: in this sense, negatively.

Frank Burch Brown correctly suggests, "When we think of something's aesthetic qualities, we do not think first of all about what makes it religious or moral. We think about what makes it rewarding just to look at or listen to, and so to savor in itself."\[43\] It is the inherent attraction that brings one to participate further with the creation presented through the art, thus it is important here to focus on Christlikeness in each individual detail: that which is pleasing to the living God, Christ. O'Connor notes that scripture tells of the temple having a "dedicated group of musicians, instrumentalists and choral singers whose role in worship followed a definite routine."\[44\] The details of the routine were not only important to YHWH, but were directly drawn out in scripture. Presenting anything less than the attention to detail God prescribed was to offer worship not worthy. Likewise, Richard Viladesau points out the same idea is found in the Protestant Reformation:

The strictures placed on sacred music...signify the attempt to assure that music serves as a vehicle for the word rather than constituting an end in itself; for music is a language of its own and can overpower the words it carries, making them into mere sounds to carry notes. The median can in truth become the message---a potentially different message from that embodied in word⁠.\[45\]

Thus, technology today too---when not focused on the details pointing to Christ---takes on meanings of its own. Explaining this in a modern context, Schultze notes that technology is three-fold: (1) it is the physical equipment used in service of God; (2) the meanings that we attach to the equipment; and (3) the way the equipment is used.\[46\] I propose a fourth: the meaning the congregation perceives from the final product, which may or may not be the meaning intended from the technical artist. Each of these details works together to create the whole. Therefore caution at each step is essential as to not create diversions from the ultimate goal. "Our problem in a technological society," writes Schultze, "\[is\] our lives become flurries of technique, races from one diversion to the next, nearly nonstop indulgences that mediated clatter and clutter."\[47\] Technology's power of diversion is its devil.

Revered worship songwriter, Bob Kauflin posed the rhetorical question: "Does God even care whether or not we use music to worship him?"\[48\] He answers:

Apparently so. The Bible's longest book is a collection of songs. God commands both instrumental and vocal praise in Scripture. Psalm 150 says we're to praise the Lord with horns, cymbals, and strings. ... But if we don't understand God's purpose for music in worship, we can misuse it. Even worse, it can rob God of the glory we want to give him.\[49\]

Kauflin's answer suggests an important aspect of the technical arts. One cannot know how to use a liturgical object without acknowledgment of the purpose of it. It is possible to follow a particular set of religious practices, and still not truly worship God.\[50\] Technical arts demonstrate know-how through being proactive in performance: Can you keep focus on Christ, when all goes wrong? Can you incorporate the liturgical details so that each individual element focuses on Christ? Huyser-Honig points out that every detail is an opportunity to point the congregation to God: "Stained glass, electric guitars, incense, bold banners, conga drums, projected images, fresh-baked bread, video cameras, Advent candles. All have potential to help worshipers commune with God and each other."\[51\] Ron Rienstra adds, "To carefully discern the proper use of technology, then, requires recalling worship's primary purpose, reminding ourselves of the central things to which we attend when God's people assemble to worship."\[52\] Every individual aspect should work together to lift up the congregation to God. Art's ability to reach the human heart through presented objects can serve as a vehicle for God to touch and transform hearts in a way that words and ritual alone cannot.

**The Whole Is Greater than the Sum of Its Parts**

In his Metaphysics, Aristotle expressed, "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts" (common paraphrase).\[53\] Technical artists are known for being "into the gear," so concentrating on the details is often not the difficult part. The overwhelming percentage of articles in church tech trade magazines that focus on the newest and greatest equipment compared to the number that focus on spiritual growth confirm this.\[54\] Being able to keep the big picture in mind while in the heat of the job is a common pitfall many technical artists cite.\[55\] Nonetheless, the worship service in its entirety tells a deeper story than each individual aspect. In a study of evangelical CCM trends, Matthew Sigler discovered the importance of focusing on the complete 'song set' itself and how songs are linked and molded as a larger body, because that is how the worship leader and the congregation will experience it. Each individual element is a component of the larger story. "When linked with other songs in the 'set,' a particular song may take on a different nuance than it would on its own."\[56\] Consequently, constant awareness of the overall metanarrative is essential.

For Christians, the narrative whole is the gospel of Christ. Does the final artistic product as move the congregation to recognize who Christ is and what he has done? Does it produce a reaction of faith and repentance? Indeed, "being theologically sound is more than avoiding error or having some Scripture quotes in a song,"\[57\] writes Lester Ruth. "It involves participating in the full, rich vision of the God disclosed in the New Testament."\[58\] Schultze, Chuang, and Redman, explain: "You have to have a good, proper, fitting sense of what worship should be \[theologically\], and then you can integrate technology well within that framework."\[59\] The gospel is primary, and technology is secondary---in support of the central focal point of salvation through Christ. Huyser-Honig writes, "Thinking about how God desires to shape and prune worshipers is more important...than questions about tempos, key signatures, musical segues, instrumentation, or clothing style;"\[60\] therefore each must fit so that God can shape those worshipping him. Knowing how the music, lighting, and scene work together to form disciples is more important than the specific gear used to do it. Worshipers---and Christ---do not care whether the audio desk is a new digital "today's-popular" series or an old analog "throw-it-out-before-it-burns-the-place-down" console, but they do mind if feedback and distorted sounds muffle the melody accompanying their worship in song. There are even ties to this historically, as Begbie notes, "The idea of listening to music purely for its own sake---primarily for aesthetic interest or as some kind of object of contemplation (as in a concert hall)---would be unknown in this \[first-century\] culture⁠."\[61\] From the beginning, music and the arts were about tradition and bringing an offering of oneself to God. The purpose the arts is the glorification of God. All art ought then enable that purpose, including the technical arts.

"Truth set to music has the potential to engage the whole person,"\[62\] Detwiler rightly states. Protestants stand on the foundation of Sola Scriptura; seeing that, scripturally, music and the arts are performed in times of transition, celebration, mourning, and in praise to God, they possess the intrinsic ability to 'speak' biblical truth in a deeper way than preaching alone. Rhythm and melody are vehicles for transmission, along with tension, dissonance, and resolution. "Beyond the selection of worship songs on the basis of tempo, key signature, theme, or other qualities," Toledo writes, "worship that will transform the lives of the worshipers and proclaims the greatness of God requires a depth of theological introspection and maturity that comes only after dedicated study and the work of the Holy Spirit."\[63\] Truth enhances the arts; the arts enhance biblical truth. John Calvin, who was generally against music in worship, other than the monophonic singing of the psalms, acknowledged, music "has a sacred and almost incredible power to move hearts in one way or another. Therefore we ought to be even more diligent in regulating it in such a way that it shall be useful to us and in no way pernicious."\[64\] Begbie adds, as a whole music ought to possess "a gravity and majesty appropriate to the worship of God, with no lightness or frivolity⁠."\[65\] Ultimately, the way artists perform their craft is not the way to salvation, yet it can be sanctifying. The work has been accomplished, in Christ's saving work. Therefore, the whole of the craft ought to point the congregation to recognition of that end.

**Engagers and Enablers**

Art completes its meaning when shared. Craftsmanship of the technical artist projects biblical meaning to the congregation. It both engages the audience to participate and enables worship that responds to the saving grace of Christ. Tim Keller summaries the difference art makes in worshipping God: "Merely learning a truth about God is intellectual education, not worship. ... I haven't worshiped unless that truth descends from my mind and touches my emotions and my will."\[66\] In 1 Corinthians 14:26, Paul lists some of the various gifts believers bring to create the worship service: "a hymn \[psalmos\], a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation." One of the five aspects---'hymn'---is clearly artistic in nature, with 'tongues' and 'interpretations' allowing for the possibility of metaphorical clarification of gospel truths. They engage and enable the congregation to worship "so that all may learn and all be encouraged" (14:31). In the Book of Revelation, many references to worship in song exist, including the four living creatures and twenty-four elders (4:8-11; 5:9-10), adding the angels to them (5:12-13), and the song of Moses (15:3-4). Furthermore, it can be deduced that poetics of loud sounds, crying out, and mourning, all in unison contained some amount of singing or artistic presentation. The key component in all of these is that they are all communal in nature. They serve a purpose within the body that captures them all in emotional outpouring. The technical arts, likewise, reach their ultimate purpose when they are practiced corporately.

According to Hearon, these scriptural representations directly parallel a highly integrated use of music in the early Jesus communities: "Vocal and instrumental music played an integral role in festivals and religious ceremonies, theatrical productions, and rites of passage such as weddings and funerals. It was also a primary mode of formal and informal entertainment at meals, in homes, and while working."\[67\] Culturally, music was embedded in the fabric of their existence, similar to today. The difference however, as noted earlier, the use would not be music for the sake of music: it was purposeful, and selected for fittingness and appropriateness. Contemporary technical artists and worship leaders today ought follow suit, recognizing that specific songs types, genres, and musical qualities better fit the doctrinal message. "Some styles or techniques in music are peculiarly apt to express sacred meaning⁠."\[68\] For example, a tongue-in-cheek worship phenomenon called the "7-11 Song"---seven words sung eleven times---is often mocked as simplistic to some worship leaders. However, Psalm 136 could in-turn easily be considered a "6-26 Song" with its repetitive but powerful use of "for his steadfast love endures forever." Stephen Altrogge proposes one important value: "Repetition and simplicity...allows us to grapple with truths in ways we can't when we are moving quickly through multiple verses of substantial depth. We so easily forget eternal truths, and repetition and reminder drill God's truth deeply into our hearts."\[69\] In this same way, liturgical elements like communion, prayer, and collection of tithes and offerings, often utilize simple yet captivating music to heighten the drama and/or response. Proper lighting and audio become necessary ways to guide congregants through the worship experience. To answer to whether any modern worship service "can be done without technology and the simple answer for that is no."\[70\] Thus, 'catering' the service technologically is a necessity in a contemporary world where liturgical tradition has been banished. Silence and lack of direction leave worshipers lost.

Technology that connects, engages the whole body. Mikie Roberts recognized an important change when technology began to force printed hymnals out of the sanctuary. People began to worship deeper through whole-body interaction of arms and bodily rhythmic impulse. "It allowed for more engagement of the body as an expression of worship. ... Congregational singing became a 'hands-free' activity. Consequently, the congregation was motivated to employ the rest of their bodies in worship as they sang."\[71\] In this way, not being anchored to an established text, allows worship to fit the cultural context. "It is perhaps less common in our culture for worship services to feature all of the activities mentioned in the Psalms---dancing, the raising of hands or festal processions," writes Guthrie. "Nevertheless, most Christian worship does include singing and the playing of instruments, standing and sitting at fixed times, and the sharing of bread and wine. Kneeling, and the clapping of hands are also common embodied elements of Christian worship.\[72\] Engaged worship is not a spectator sport, but demands full physical participation. The technical artist---as mediator between stage and congregation---serves an essential role in achieving this: is the artist disengaged or active in every aspect as demonstrated by Stagl's blog post? Additionally, Martin Stringer cites the late seventeenth-century hymnal practices:

Long and torturous sermons dominated the worship and singing had slowed almost to a halt. ... The practice of 'lining out' a hymn, whereby the minister or leader would sing a line followed by the congregation, along with the desire for inspired singing (that is without fixed tunes), had lead to a situation where each note could last for seconds and the whole psalm could take twenty to thirty minutes to sing.\[73\]

The biblical solution "to such empty ritualism," writes Kevin Vanhoozer, "is worship 'in spirit and truth' (John 4: 23), whereby one's embodied life is animated by the Spirit and oriented by the Scriptures."\[74\] Thus, "Disciples should approach all of life \[specially corporate worship\] with the intention of offering their time and talents as living sacrifices that celebrate, and correspond to, the reality of the already/not-yet reign of Christ on earth⁠."\[75\] Technology in worship, then, becomes the vehicle for congregations to offer their whole body in worship of Christ.

**Universal Constraints Promote Freedom in Craft**

Craftsmanship requires knowledge of current practices in the field, yet also must be open to discover new forms and methods. "Traditions were at one time innovations,"\[76\] writes Schultze. Begbie faults the church for being too controlling, asserting the church needs to give more room for artists to experiment so to appropriately advance alongside the changing culture.\[77\] Huyser-Honig relates this to the concept "layering." Using the universal scientific principles of mathematical musicology as the base, for example, "you \[then\] add layers of visuals, sounds, and experiences that help worshipers more fully and consciously understand and act on God's word."\[78\] John Paul Ito explains: "Mathematical structure resonates with fundamental aspects of how God has ordered both the cosmos and human beings. ... Freedom and constraint in music \[and the arts\] is illustrative of larger theological principles."\[79\] In other words, technical artists are constrained to universal laws of nature established by God, i.e. in the way notes harmonize and colors mix to create other colors. From a base that is fitting, artists ought then be free to use technology to explore opportunities to connect worshipers with Christ.

Begbie warns that the modern church, however, is tempted to play it safe by using arts in ways that appeal to the masses in order to fill seats. The hope, nonetheless, is that the arts can open new methods of congregational worship while remaining theologically responsible. Begbie makes an interesting note that though a certain conservatism and simplicity does have a place, "one would have hoped that a movement that can put such weight on the Holy Spirit's renewal could generate somewhat more adventurous material⁠."\[80\] Schultze, Chuang, and Redman, are more optimistic with what they have witnessed in the technical arts as theatrically engaging worship services are necessitated in order to gain members.

What we're seeing with different kinds of musical styles, requiring different instrumentation and the like, is that, in some cases, the church started many years ago with a guy on a guitar and somebody running an overhead projector, and it's morphed into this ministry where there are many, many people involved, playing different kinds of instruments, singing, dancing, or doing whatever. In a sense, once churches began to realize that they didn't always have to have a pianist or an organist to accompany musical worship, you could do all sorts of things, and then all sorts of different people began to get involved.\[81\]

Where churches used to play it safe with technology in fear of losing members, today, churches that push the bounds of technical worship to a higher standard are the ones attracting Millennials. In fact, "the grand fear of people who want to keep media out of church is that they will lose traditions \[and visitors\]. But experimenting with technology opens a liturgical treasure trove."\[82\]

In conclusion, we must be willing to test the boundaries. Like many scriptural narratives, good art has delayed closes, build and climax, and create tension that calls for resolution. The end is not always as we thought, but God has a greater plan working toward his end. Every dissonant biblical narrative ultimately ends, however, in the saving work of Christ. Begbie articulates this metaphorically in regards to the daily lives of believers:

To be drawn into the waves of God means that our lives are set in the context, not of a linear path, but of a multileveled hope that covers a huge range of timescales. There may be very small waves at work---the little short-term routines of our lives, for example---but we live in the confidence that even these can be taken up in the longer-reaching purposes of God, the wide and vast waves of God's music.\[83\]

Technology creates God's music when form meets function. Technical artists demonstrate tekhnê when form and function align to present the gospel of Christ.

She writes "multi-modal dimensions of music: the descriptive markers 'tone,' 'rhythm,' and even to a certain degree 'melody,' for example, are shared with spoken language." It can be concluded then that these known tendencies to add artist form to spoken word as universal principles translate to some degree to the same practices performed today.
